How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    You can find all the modifications you have made between two versions and 
	find where the bug is without reading the whole file again

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Losing less time in bug fixing leaves more free time for real work

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: create a meaningful version that is stable and can work while google
	will have versions that are in the middle of a change;
	cons: don't forget to save!!

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    git is more project oriented, while google docs is just a doc managing source?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    don't know those commands...

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    you can always revert to a working version so you don't have to worry about 
	"breaking" something

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Finish this MOOC and start the real stuff!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

	Loose less time when you need to get back to an older version (when your pc
	crashes, or when you made a mistake)
