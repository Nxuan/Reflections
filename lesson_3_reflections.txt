When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you need to use it online (on the move) or when you have to share the data with someone else

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Some commits aren't fully functionnal and you might get a version that isn't ready for sharing

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks are clones on github, while branches are different versions of the same repository.
	forks are useful when you want to work on a repository but have no right to modify it.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    so you don't have to worry about merges again, since you are up to date.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    we would have to check all the changes and talk, while git makes it easier to spot differences
	without even having to meet.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    when you are working with other people and need to keep your work separate from the master branch
	you can start your own branch and do a pull request when the new feat is over. that way each member can
	be responsible of his own branch and still request merges into the master branch together when all the 
	work is done.
